# Phase 1

Distributed generation of powers of tau for Phase 1 of [BGM17](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1050). 

Also contains a binary which converts the Powers of Tau to Lagrange coefficients and allows Phase 2 to produce efficient A, B and L queries for the Groth16 SNARK.

- Utilizes [Zexe's algebra crate](https://github.com/scipr-lab/zexe), meaning we support all available curves:
    - BLS12-377
    - BW6-761
    - ...
- Memory footprint can be configured by adjusting `batch-size` via CLI and via environment variable [`RAYON_NUM_THREADS`](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-many-threads-will-rayon-spawn).
